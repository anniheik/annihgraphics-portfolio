LEARNING DIARY, FRONT END MODULE


Thursday 22. June
General course introduction and first lesson

Today I started the course as a FITech student, I have graduated from LUT Business Analytics in the beginning of 2021.
I've been working as a data scientist for couple of years now but as we are moving more towards web applications
I've needed to learn developing proper UI's for my applications instead of having users run them in command prompt. 
At the first glance this front end course seems to give me all the tools to start working a bit more user friendly applications.

The course details seemed clear and it was easy to choose code VSCode as code editor as it is the one I use every day.
I wasn't familiar with the bitbucket and setting that up seemed a bit tricky so I decided to go with GitHub for easier
version control as I'm more familiar with that. 

Did all the steps described in the part 1 video about the initial workflow. Created index-page with classic hello world,
set up sass and some styles to the first page. No issues and everything went very smoothly. It's good to continue from here
next time. Also, committed the changes to Git with gitignore file to drop the mode modules from the version control.
