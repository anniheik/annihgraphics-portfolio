LEARNING DIARY, FRONT END MODULE


Thursday 22. June
General course introduction and first part

Today I started the course as a FITech student, I have graduated from LUT Business Analytics in the beginning of 2021.
I've been working as a data scientist for couple of years now but as we are moving more towards web applications
I've needed to learn developing proper UI's for my applications instead of having users run them in command prompt. 
At the first glance this front end course seems to give me all the tools to start working a bit more user friendly applications.

The course details seemed clear and it was easy to choose code VSCode as code editor as it is the one I use every day.
I wasn't familiar with the bitbucket and setting that up seemed a bit tricky so I decided to go with GitHub for easier
version control as I'm more familiar with that. 

Did all the steps described in the part 1 video about the initial workflow. Created index-page with classic hello world,
set up sass and some styles to the first page. No issues and everything went very smoothly. It's good to continue from here
next time. Also, committed the changes to Git with gitignore file to drop the mode modules from the version control.

Sunday 25. June
Second part
Today I started working on the second video of the series and at first I needed to remind myself how do I
opened the site on a live server. Checked quickly the previous video and found the button from options for running
the script on live server. Then I noticed that the changes I made in sass weren't moving to the open app. 
Checked the previous video again and found the command npm run sass to see the chanegs. 

I was good to continue with the part 2 video and followed the instructions without too many issues. It has been 
a bit tricky to follow the structure of the html script as there are lots of lines. At some point I had missed
adding an id to the body tag and later I couldn't make my background image visible. I tried to confirm that my 
image is in correct format, in the correct url etc. but after checking the video comments, someone else had the
same issue as well and found the missing id from the body. 

Otherwise I started deviate from the tutorial design a bit to move more towards my own project but still keeping
most of the main elements that I wanted to learn. My design portfolio is currently made in Squarespace platform but
during this project I was planning to recreate the portfolio on my own and perhaps later end the Squarespace
subscription in case the end product looks at least as nice as the original and I manage to publish the site.

Friday 21. July 

Took a break from this course due to summer vacation and had forgotten quite a lot of stuff in between. Needed a proper
refresh but after reading the learning diary, checking the code I had written previously got back in track in just 30 minutes.

I followed the third video and learned to assign properties to the html classes in JS (not 100 % sure what they are called). Got the
menu button working with JavaScript and scss as shown in the video. I also learned how to check the browser development tools to check for
details and if the page is working as expected.

In video 4 I started having more issues. First the portrait wasn't showing right, solved that simply by cropping the image separately and adding
"background-size: cover" property to the portrait class. The portrait was transparent and I solved this issue by removing the opacity 0.9 from the 
menu class and added the transparencies straight to the nav and branding backgrounds. Someone had the issue in the comments of the video and I found
the solution there. Overall the comment section has been very helpful but otherwise I've been trying to think for solutions myself or by Googling.

The navigation side has been tricky as the links coming from the right transition isn't working and I couldn't find the solution in the comments or myself yet.
I did find out that in the index.html my navigation list was not written correctly. The links were not inside each list item. Hence the nav-item class 
formatting wasn't working. After fixing that all the links got lost and that's caused by the transition again. Couldn't find solution to this issue
and got tired so stopped the 4th video at 19:09.

Saturday 22. July

Started with the previous navigation issue but could not solve it. Decided to leave the links sliding from the right out as I didn't find it 
very important element anyways.

Continued the video 4 and created the responsive mixins with the small/medium screensize contents. Here I started to deviate from the tutorial 
as I didn't like the look of the responsive (small) navigation in the video. I decided to keep the font size larger, make both of the sides (portrait and the menu)
slide from the same side when opening the menu and also played around with the menu alignments. Overall I'm not a fan of keeping my image in the menu
so I might take that away later in the process but for now I have kept it there.

Decided to continue to the video 5 and added the conditional text color to all of the texts and the navigation button. Also tested it and worked as expected
when I changed the primary color to darker one. Created the about page and copied the index code to the about page but then I lost focus and decided to end the video
at 5:54 for today.

Tuesday 8. August

Back at it again. Started where I finished last week with the About page video (number 5). After summer vacation I started to work on the UI for an application
I'm building at work and after working on this course until this point I had actually learned enough HTML/CSS to actually build simple but at least usable and somewhat good 
looking user interface for the application.

For my own project, I found the gridding very useful. I have built websites using Squarespace and using the grid actually reminded be of working in more
visual website builder tools. I found it very intuitive and easy to understand. So far, this is the biggest takeaway from this course and I think is very useful 
when I continue working on the project further especially in the portfolio part where I'm planning to present my work.

The sticky footer tip was useful too, I had seen the footer not showing correctly on other webpages and wouldn't have noticed to fix it myself if it wasn't mentioned
in the video. Otherwise today I just quicky went through the video and didn't differ from it too much this time.


Notes:

-how to start running? - left click and open live server
-compile css? - npm run sass
