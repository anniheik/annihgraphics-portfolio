LEARNING DIARY, FRONT END MODULE


Thursday 22. June
General course introduction and first part

Today I started the course as a FITech student, I have graduated from LUT Business Analytics in the beginning of 2021.
I've been working as a data scientist for couple of years now but as we are moving more towards web applications
I've needed to learn developing proper UI's for my applications instead of having users run them in command prompt. 
At the first glance this front end course seems to give me all the tools to start working a bit more user friendly applications.

The course details seemed clear and it was easy to choose code VSCode as code editor as it is the one I use every day.
I wasn't familiar with the bitbucket and setting that up seemed a bit tricky so I decided to go with GitHub for easier
version control as I'm more familiar with that. 

Did all the steps described in the part 1 video about the initial workflow. Created index-page with classic hello world,
set up sass and some styles to the first page. No issues and everything went very smoothly. It's good to continue from here
next time. Also, committed the changes to Git with gitignore file to drop the mode modules from the version control.

Second part
Today I started working on the second video of the series and at first I needed to remind myself how do I
opened the site on a live server. Checked quickly the previous video and found the button from options for running
the script on live server. Then I noticed that the changes I made in sass weren't moving to the open app. 
Checked the previous video again and found the command npm run sass to see the chanegs. 

I was good to continue with the part 2 video and followed the instructions without too many issues. It has been 
a bit tricky to follow the structure of the html script as there are lots of lines. At some point I had missed
adding an id to the body tag and later I couldn't make my background image visible. I tried to confirm that my 
image is in correct format, in the correct url etc. but after checking the video comments, someone else had the
same issue as well and found the missing id from the body. 

Otherwise I started deviate from the tutorial design a bit to move more towards my own project but still keeping
most of the main elements that I wanted to learn. My design portfolio is currently made in Squarespace platform but
during this project I was planning to recreate the portfolio on my own and perhaps later end the Squarespace
subscription in case the end product looks at least as nice as the original and I manage to publish the site.





Notes:
